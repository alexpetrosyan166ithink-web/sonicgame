        tips: {
            "addition": "Practice adding numbers by counting on your fingers or using a number line — start at the bigger number and count up!",
            "subtraction": "To subtract, count backwards from the bigger number, or think of it as asking: what do I add to get there?",
            "multiplication": "Times tables are easier with tricks! 6 × 4 is the same as 4 groups of 6. Try skip counting to check your answer.",
            "shapes": "Look around you — shapes are everywhere! A stop sign is an octagon, a window is a rectangle. Count the corners to find the sides.",
            "counting": "Skip counting means jumping by the same number each time. Counting by 5s: 5, 10, 15, 20 — like counting nickels!",
            "patterns": "Look for what changes between each number. Is it going up by the same amount each time? That's the pattern key!"
